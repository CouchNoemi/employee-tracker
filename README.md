# employee-tracker


## description

 I created an  interface that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in the  database. I built a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
Because this Challenge will require the use of the `Inquirer` package, ensure that you install and use Inquirer version 8.2.4. To do so, use the following command in your project folder: `npm i inquirer@8.2.4`.
I created a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality
You are  able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in the company.
You can view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role, view employees by manager, and , view employees by department.

 ## Usage
 - To use the back end app download all the files
 - For this application I used the express package.
-  Before starting to use the application make sure the packages are installed on the app use (nmp i).
-Its gonna let you track all your information. Just open the terminal and type node server.js to start.
